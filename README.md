# Graphics Generator

THIS PROGRAM REQUIRES MARS (MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator) to run the code. 

In this program I implemented functions that perform some primitive graphics operations on a small simulated display. 
These functions will clear the entire display to a color, display rectangular and diamond shapes using a 
memory-mapped bitmap graphics display tool in MARS. To do this I utilized:
Arrays
Memory-mapped Input/Output (IO)
Subroutines (a.k.a. Functions or Procedures)
Macros
The MIPS Stack (for arguments and subroutine call state)
